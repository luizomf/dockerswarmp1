# Current Plan

## Task: Create video outline (start to finish)

Create a practical, honest video recording outline that walks from zero to a
working 3-VPS Docker Swarm baseline, including tradeoffs (SPOFs) and a clear
"how to evolve" section. This should be a recording checklist + script beats,
not new infrastructure work.

Current Date: 2026-02-06

- [ ] Step 1: Draft the outline content and section timing.
- [ ] Step 2: Add a persistent doc under docs/ with the outline.
- [ ] Step 3: Ensure commands/paths match the current repo (Justfile/stack).
- [ ] Step 4: Update CHANGELOG.md.
- [ ] Step 5: Clear PLAN.md (remove all completed content).

_(Note: Once all items are checked `[x]`, this file should be cleared for the
next task)_
