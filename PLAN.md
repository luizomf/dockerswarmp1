# Current Plan

## Task: Add DEV_GUIDE and detailed video script

Create a separate developer guide (server bootstrap + prerequisites) so the
main README and the video can stay focused. Also create a detailed recording
script broken into smaller sections to keep pacing/engagement.

Current Date: 2026-02-06

- [ ] Step 1: Review the old reference guide and current project docs.
- [ ] Step 2: Add DEV_GUIDE.md tailored to this repo (3 VPS Swarm baseline).
- [ ] Step 3: Add docs/VIDEO_SCRIPT.md (section-by-section script beats).
- [ ] Step 4: Update CHANGELOG.md.
- [ ] Step 5: Clear PLAN.md (remove all completed content).

_(Note: Once all items are checked `[x]`, this file should be cleared for the
next task)_
